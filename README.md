Rationale
=========

Survival analysis typically separates a patient cohort by some measure and compares the relative survival between groups. In practice, for a continuous measure, the decision of *where* to draw this division relies on previous knowledge or, more problematically, it may simply be a researchers best guess - for example separating around the median. Amongst other examples the associated vignettes outlined 3 alternative survival analysis approaches --- **median**, **hypothesis-driven** and our own **data-driven** approach as part of the `survivALL` package.
